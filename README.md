# 🪁 Kite

A lightweight, self-hosted caching CDN for npm-compatible registries.

## Overview

Kite provides a simple HTTP API for fetching package files from an npm-compatible registry. 

It's mainly designed for use in online playgrounds and sandboxes (see [browser Import Map API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/importmap)).

## Inspiration

This project was heavily inspired by [unpkg](https://unpkg.com). While unpkg provides a fantastic public CDN, Kite focuses on bringing that same simplicity to your private infrastructure and self-hosted environments.
